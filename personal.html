    <h1> Volunteer, hiker, and tennis player</h1>
    <div id="deco2"></div>
      <p class="dropped"><span class="first-phrase"> I have been playing tennis since I was seven years old. </span> I have always been interested in playing tennis as many
        members were also avid tennis players and excelled at the sport. It was first a hobby for me but I quickly developed a desire to have competition, and enjoyed the battles
        of being out on the court. On the court, you learn from a young age that you are in the fight alone in a match without any help. This helped me develop the ability to work
        alone an to figure out my problems by myself if I run into them. While tennis is very much a team sport at the colleg level, you have your own battle each match and you do
        not have the luxury of blaming someone else when you have a bad day. These are lessons that I believe I can carry with me into the workforce, and help contribute in many ways.</p>

      <h2> Avid hiker</h2>
      <p> I spend a lot of my free time outdoors, particularly going on hikes.</p>

      <h2>Volunteer work</h2>
      <p>I have greatly enjoyed the esprit de corps and giving spirit of my tennis team, engaging in cooperative efforts
        such as community trash-pick up initiatives. As mentioned in the page on my <a href="professional.html">professional</a> involvements, I am also avidly involved in my community volunteering as an art museum tour guide.</p>
